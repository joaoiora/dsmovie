# Movie Ratings

## Description

Monorepo for a web application using Java with Spring Boot and Spring Data on the backend, and React on the frontend.

The application consists of a simple MVP for rating movies. The rating requires an score and the reviewer's e-mail address.

If the reviewer has already reviewed a movie, the amount of reviews and the review average note will be recalculated on the backend, and the star rating will be updated as well on the frontend.
